# <h1> PredRBAθ: Adaptive RBAθ Event Prediction Method for Wind Turbine Monitoring Using Agentic and Advanced Signal Processing Techniques

**Definition**: A sudden change in time-varying data is termed as an event. For example, a day (24 h) can be summed up with a few
events rather than 24 individual points. This algorithm identifies such events and classifies them into **stationary** or **significant** events.
An abrupt change is understood as a **significant** event, while a persistent flat interval is classified as **stationary**. The rest of the data carry little
importance in decision-making contexts.

PredRBAθ extends the classical RBA-theta algorithm with:

- Enhanced Event Detection (Existing)
- Event Prediction(Extended Development)

### ▶ How to Run

1. Environment Setup
Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)

```
conda env create --name pred_rba -f rba_non-spatial_environment.yml
conda activate pred_rba
```
Option B: Using pip

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Main Orchestrator

```
python main.py
```

Interactive prompts will guide you through:

Mode Selection:

1 - Event Detection (Analyze historical events)
2 - Event Prediction (Forecast future events)

Dataset Selection:

Enter path to your Excel file (e.g., input_data/Baltic_Eagle.xlsx)

The current input_data folder is empty, so need to include your own data in there. Also, you need to run full end-to-end training on a dataset first, and then you can use transfer learning-zero shot on some other data saved in the same input_data folder. It was neeeded to adjust the space to upload in the Github.

Configuration (varies by mode)

### Version History

This is version 0.3.0, i.e, the PredRBAθ framework. Previous implementations can be found in release 0.2.0 and 0.1.0 contains the original RBAθ framework.
